// Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Each array element represents the maximum length of the jumps that can be made forward from that element. This means if arr[i] = x, then we can jump any distance y such that y â‰¤ x.
// Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array starting from the first element. If an element is 0, then you cannot move through that element.
// Note:  Return -1 if you can't reach the end of the array.

// Examples : 

// Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
// Output: 3 
// Explanation:First jump from 1st element to 2nd element with value 3. From here we jump to 5th element with value 9, and from here we will jump to the last. 

// Input: arr = {1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7}
// Output: 2 
// Explanation: First we jump from the 1st to 2nd element and then jump to the last element.

// Input: arr = {0, 10, 20}
// Output: -1
// Explanation: We cannot go anywhere from the 1st element.

// Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
// Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
